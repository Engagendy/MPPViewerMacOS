MPP Viewer is a lightweight, native macOS application that opens Microsoft Project `.mpp` files without requiring Microsoft Project. It converts project data via the [MPXJ](https://www.mpxj.org/) library and presents it through a modern SwiftUI interface with interactive Gantt charts, dashboards, task management, and PDF export.

---

## Features

### Dashboard
Get an instant overview of project health with KPI cards showing overall progress, on-track status, critical tasks, and total cost. Includes a task status breakdown bar, upcoming milestones, resource summary, and schedule timeline with days remaining.

### Gantt Chart
Interactive timeline visualization with:
- **Zoom controls** — Fit All, Week, Month presets, and manual +/- adjustment (2–100 px/day)
- **Critical path toggle** — Highlight critical tasks and dim non-critical ones
- **Today marker** — Red dashed line at the current date
- **Dependency arrows** — FS, SS, FF, SF relation types with routed connectors
- **Task bars** — Color-coded by type (normal, critical, milestone, summary) with progress fill
- **Row shading** — Alternating backgrounds and weekend highlighting
- **PDF export** — Multi-page landscape output

### Schedule View
Microsoft Project-style split view with a task list on the left and Gantt timeline on the right. Both panes share collapse/expand state and scroll together.

### Task List
Hierarchical task table with expand/collapse, sortable columns (ID, WBS, Name, Duration, Start, Finish, % Complete, Predecessors), and a detail inspector panel. Click any task to view full details including schedule, cost, assigned resources, predecessors/successors, and notes.

### Milestones & Deliverables
Dedicated view for milestones and summary deliverables with filtering (All / Milestones / Deliverables), status badges (Completed, Upcoming, Overdue), and sortable columns.

### Resources
Resource sheet showing all work and material resources with standard rates, max units, email, group, and assignment counts.

### Calendar
Visual calendar display with working/non-working day highlighting, exception days (holidays, special dates), and month navigation.

### PDF Export
- **Task List** — Vector PDF table with proper typography, hierarchy indentation, milestone markers, critical task highlighting, alternate row shading, pagination, and export timestamps
- **Gantt Chart** — Full-resolution bitmap capture across multiple landscape pages

### Additional
- **Project Summary** — Metadata, schedule info, statistics, and file information
- **Search** — Filter tasks by name across all views
- **Document-based** — Double-click any `.mpp` file to open it directly

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| macOS | 14.0 (Sonoma) or later |
| Xcode | 15.0+ |
| Java | OpenJDK 21 |

### Installing Java 21

```bash
# Homebrew (recommended)
brew install openjdk@21

# Or download Eclipse Temurin
# https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Engagendy/MPPViewerMacOS.git
cd MPPViewerMacOS
```

### 2. Build the Java converter

```bash
cd MPPConverter
mvn clean package
cd ..
```

This produces `MPPConverter/target/mpxj-converter.jar`, a fat JAR containing the MPXJ library.

### 3. Open in Xcode

```bash
open MPPViewer/MPPViewer.xcodeproj
```

### 4. Build and run

Select the **MPPViewer** scheme, choose **My Mac** as the destination, and hit **Run** (Cmd+R).

### 5. Open a `.mpp` file

Use **File > Open** or drag-and-drop any `.mpp` file onto the app.

```

### How it works

```
.mpp file → MPPConverterService (Swift)
                 ↓
         Java Process / XPC Service
                 ↓
         MPXJ (Java) → JSON
                 ↓
         JSONProjectParser (Swift)
                 ↓
         ProjectModel → SwiftUI Views
```

1. The app receives an `.mpp` file through the macOS document system
2. `MPPConverterService` invokes a Java process running the MPXJ-based converter JAR
3. MPXJ reads the binary `.mpp` format and outputs structured JSON
4. `JSONProjectParser` decodes the JSON into Swift model objects
5. SwiftUI views render the project data across all tabs

## Data Model

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ProjectModel` | Root container with properties, tasks, resources, assignments, calendars |
| `ProjectTask` | Task with schedule, progress, cost, dependencies, hierarchy (parent/children) |
| `ProjectResource` | Work or material resource with rates and contact info |
| `ResourceAssignment` | Links tasks to resources with work and cost tracking |
| `ProjectCalendar` | Working hours per weekday, exception days (holidays) |
| `TaskRelation` | Predecessor/successor with relation type (FS, SS, FF, SF) and lag |
